# Digital Transaction Signature Lab

🧩 **Description**  
This project implements a **digital transaction signature system** using **SHA-256 hashing** and **ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm)**.  
It demonstrates how a transaction message can be securely signed and verified to ensure message authenticity and data integrity.  

The lab includes:

- Transaction simulation
- SHA-256 hashing of the transaction
- ECDSA signing using a private key
- Verification using the corresponding public key
